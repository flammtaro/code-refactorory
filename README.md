# code-refactorory

## Description
- The goal of this project was to edit the layout of both the HTML and CSS so that it maintained the same
structure and layout, but was much more refined and structured in a more organized fashion.

- I built this project in order to better understand how to refine code, and to reaffirm the need to not have
duplicates of the same code if it can be helped.

-Ultimately, it solves the problem of repetive code that does the same thing over multiple functions, and it solves
the problem of being unorganized in your code.

-What I learned on this project is that certain elements can be combined if they are in the same general class or id, and any more unique specific elements can be combined in the HTML file with an extra id or class to provide greater flexibility within the same section. Also I learned that the order of the classes and sections in the CSS
matter greatly to both the structure of the code, and to the readability of the code

## Usage
This code is used as a finished product showing off the same end result as the starter code, but with more refined
CSS and HTML. An image of the before and after of the CSS can be seen here, with the left code being the annotated and refined version: ![side by side code](assets/images/codesidebyside.png)
